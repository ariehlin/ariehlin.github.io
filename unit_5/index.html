			<p> 
			when everything feels too much, <br>
			i have little escapes  <br>
			that help me get away.  <br>
			<br>
			or reminders of hope, i look to.  <br>
			these things are common. <br>
			<br>
			they bring us back to something innate -  <br>
			they bring us back to a centered place.  <br>
			to feel like thereâ€™s a thread  <br>
			holding us all together. <br>
			<br>
			it is my intention  <br>
			to curate these moments, <br>
			for myself and for others. <br>
			<br>
			if you need to detox  <br>
			from the noise of this world,  <br>
			you are welcome to visit Quiet Land.
