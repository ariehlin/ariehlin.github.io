	<h1>Quiet Land</h1>
	<p id="slogan">A respite from the noise of this world.</p>
	<img src="camp.jpg" alt="calming camping image" title="an escape from it all">
	<p> when everything feels too much, <br>
		i have little escapes <br>
		that help me get away. <br>
		<br>
		or reminders of hope, i look to. <br>
		these things are common. <br>
		
		<ul>
		<li>they bring us back to something innate - </li>
		</li>they bring us back to a centered place. </li>
		<li>to feel like thereâ€™s a thread </li>
		<li>holding us all together.</li>
		</ul>

		it is my intention <br>
		to curate these moments, <br> 
		for myself and for others. <br>
		<br>
		if you need to detox <br>
		from the noise of this world, <br>
		you are welcome to visit Quiet Land.<br>
